I am a seasoned Mobile App Developer specializing in React Native and TypeScript, with a strong emphasis on full-stack development. I bring extensive experience in every stage of the product lifecycle, from initial concept design through database architecture and user journey optimization. My expertise spans creating responsive designs with pixel-perfect precision, leveraging micro-interactions to enhance user experiences across mobile and web platforms.

In addition to my technical skills, I excel in project management and product ownership, having streamlined processes that saved significant resources and improved development efficiency.
